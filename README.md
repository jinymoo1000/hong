#i can hear you
but i wont
#every inches of me is tremabling
but not from the cold
something is familiar
#i can send you there
like a freind ive always known
im arriving
and i feels like im home
#i have always been so fortress
normal rules did not apply
is this the day
are you the way
i finally find out whyyyyy
